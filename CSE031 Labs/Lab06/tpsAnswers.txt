1. The starting segments are 0x00400000 and 0x100100000 for the text and data segments respectively

2. From the display is looks like basic is lower level/less abstract than the source code which is more readable.

3. 32 bits or 8 bytes

4. 8 Columns

5. There is no relationship between the address difference and the number of columns

6. m:   .word 20 under .data

7. 0x100100004

8. str1: .asciiz "I love CSE31!" under .data

9. 0x100100008

10. Yes, the array of characters is stored with 4 characters to a byte.

11. You set $v0 to 1 for a string call, call syscall, then exist syscall by setting $v0 to 10 and calling syscall again.

12. "la $t3, n" load the memory addres of variable n into the register $t3. $t3 will contain 0x100100000 after.


TPS 2

1. Adding too many unique instructions makes things complex, it's better to just keep a smaller of set of instructions that can be combined for more complex operations.

4. li $v0, 5 under .text

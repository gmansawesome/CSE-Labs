TPS 3
1. 4 variables were declared in the first line of main(), 2 of which (px and py) are pointers.
2. Because the variables and array aren't initialized, we are dealing with undefined behavior so the values can be anything.
3. You can prevent undefined behavior by initializing the variables.
8. The result makes sense because the address of arr consists of the entire array, which starts at the first value.
